    cue instruments - trigger of controller holding baton

You need to warm up your band before making the rounds for Christmas caroling!
Grab your conductor's baton and cue each player to play by pointing and pressing the trigger.
Practice the C major scale with each player at least twice before moving on to the main program.
(Hint: you can hear the full scale from the example score on the left.)
Metronomes are provided for the appropriate tempos for both pieces and will continue to keep time after they're cued.

I would like my effort on my audio files to be included in the rubric for this assignment.
I created all of them myself and programmed the metronomes to sync with them perfectly.
I also arranged the music myself using an online music composition software called Flat.io.
I am most proud of that endeavor and I'm excited to continue to improve this game.
